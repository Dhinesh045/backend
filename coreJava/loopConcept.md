# Loops in Java #

### Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.
### java provides Three types of Conditional statements this second  type is loop statement .

A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

Syntax :

while (boolean condition)
{
loop statements...
}

### A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

for (initialization condition; testing condition;increment/decrement)
{
statement(s)
}

### do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.

Syntax:

do
{
statements..
}
while (condition);
